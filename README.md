-Lore Snippet:
Once a proud sentinel of the sacred flame, Makswyn Ashborne earned a new name among the scattered ashes â€” the Knight Who Dies Too Often. Cursed by fate and countless falls, he wanders the ashen paths, arriving just a moment too late... or often just in time to meet his end.

Yet each death is but a lesson, each fall a step toward redemption. The Ashborne Wanderer fights on with a wry smile hidden beneath his helm, proving that even the most fallen knight can rise again.
